ChatActivity:

In the loop inside databaseReference.addValueEventListener(), the logic is a bit complex. Consider breaking it down into smaller methods for better readability and maintainability.
The code for loading and handling messages could potentially be separated into its own method, as it contains a lot of nested logic.
MessLists could be renamed to MessageList for consistency.

MessagesAdapter:

When inflating the layout in onCreateViewHolder, consider using parent.inflate(R.layout.messages_adapter_layout, parent, false) instead of LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.messages_adapter_layout, null). This approach provides the correct parent and avoids potential issues with view recycling.

SettingActivity:
You might want to add some error checking in the loadUserData method to ensure that the gender, sexuality, location, and birthdate values are not null before setting them.

General
Consider using more meaningful variable names. For example, messLists could be named something like messageLists for clarity.
