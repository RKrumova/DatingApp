# Dating App

## Project Description

The plan is to create a dating app that connects people and keeps track of dates. So the date is not forgotten.  The app will allow users to create profiles, browse other user profiles, and initiate chats with matches. The questionnaire will be used to help users find compatible matches based on their answers to a series of questions related to their interests, hobbies, and educational background.
## Features:
### Dates - calendar 
It keeeps track of all dates saved and enlisted. 
For a date there will be reminders and both persons - **prevents _forgetting_**.
Keeps list and count of all resheduled dates - so you know when a person is often _busy_.
Interesting thing is  _if a person cancels a lot of dates {already sheduled}_ it will be flagged.
And a person has to go out with people from time to time or he is banned for using it only for social media.
### Chats
Talk in a friendly and informal way.

### Authentication

 **An individual account**  - an account not connnected to social media.

**Meta / Facebook** - use your facebook account. Keep in mind that both parties have access to your data. 

**Google** -  use your google account. Keep in mind that both parties have access to your data.
