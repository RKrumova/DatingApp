# Dating App

## Project Description

The plan is to create a dating app that uses a questionnaire to match users based on shared interests, including educational topics. The app will allow users to create profiles, browse other user profiles, and initiate chats with matches. The questionnaire will be used to help users find compatible matches based on their answers to a series of questions related to their interests, hobbies, and educational background.
